  <h2>Party in Power</h2>
  <p>
    The party in power whether at the Centre or in the State or States concerned, shall ensure that no cause is given for any complaint
    that it has used its official position for the purposes of its election campaign and in particular –
    <br><br>
    (a) The Ministers shall not combine their official visit with electioneering work
    and shall not also make use of official machinery or personnel during the electioneering work.
    (b) Government transport including official aircraft, vehicles, machinery, and personnel shall
    not be used for furtherance of the interest of the party in power; Public places such as maidens etc.,
    for holding election meetings, and use of helipads for air-flights in connection with elections shall
    not be monopolized by itself. Other parties and candidates shall be allowed the use of such places
    and facilities on the same terms and conditions on which they are used by the party in power;
    Rest houses, dak bungalows, or other Government accommodation shall not be monopolized by the party in power
    or its candidates and such accommodation shall be allowed to be used by other parties and candidates
    in a fair manner but no party or candidate shall use or be allowed to use such accommodation
    (including premises appertaining thereto) as a campaign office or for holding any public meeting for
    the purposes of election propaganda; Issue of advertisement at the cost of public exchequer in the newspapers
    and other media and the misuse of official mass media during the election period for partisan coverage
    of political news and publicity regarding achievements with a view to furthering the prospects of the party
    in power shall be scrupulously avoided. Ministers and other authorities shall not sanction grants/payments
    out of discretionary funds from the time elections are announced by the Commission; and
    From the time elections are announced by Commission, Ministers and other authorities shall not –
    (a) announce any financial grants in any form or promises thereof; or
    (b) (except civil servants) lay foundation stones etc. of projects or schemes of any kind; or
    (c) make any promise of construction of roads, provision of drinking water facilities etc.; or
    (d) make any ad-hoc appointments in Government, Public Undertakings etc. which may have the effect
    of influencing the voters in favor of the party in power.
    Note: The Commission shall announce the date of any election which shall be a date ordinarily
    not more than three weeks prior to the date on which the notification is likely to be issued in
    respect of such elections. Ministers of Central or State Government shall not enter any
    polling station or place of counting except in their capacity as a candidate or voter or
    authorized agent.
