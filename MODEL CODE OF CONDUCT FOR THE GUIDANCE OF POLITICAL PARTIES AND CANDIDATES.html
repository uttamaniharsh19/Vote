    the meeting if such orders exist, they shall be followed strictly. If any exemption is required from such orders, it shall be applied
    for and obtained well in time. If permission or license is to be obtained for the use of loudspeakers or any other facility in connection
    with any proposed meeting, the party or candidate shall apply to the authority concerned well in advance and obtain such permission or license.
    Organizers of a meeting shall invariably seek the assistance of the police on duty for dealing with persons disturbing a meeting or otherwise
    attempting to create disorder. Organizers themselves shall not take action against such persons.
