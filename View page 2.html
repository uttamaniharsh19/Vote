    <p>The 13th Lok Sabha (10 October 1999 – 6 February 2004) is the thirteenth session of the Lok Sabha (House of the People, or lower house in the Parliament of India).</p>
    <p>It was convened after the 1999 Indian general election held during September–October 1999.</p>
    <p>The majority group in the Lok Sabha during this period was the National Democratic Alliance, a nationalist group led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, which won 270 seats, 16 more than 12th Lok Sabha.</p>
    <p>The NDA, under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee completed its term until the next general elections of May 2004 for the next 14th Lok Sabha. This was the first non-INC government to complete the full term.</p>
