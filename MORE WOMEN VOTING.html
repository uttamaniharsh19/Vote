  <p>India's women voters will surpass male voters from 2029 general election onwards: Report</p>
  <p>A major shift in India's electoral landscape is anticipated by the end of this decade.</p>
  <p>A report by the SBI has claimed that women voters in India will surpass male voters from 2029 onwards.</p>
  <p>In the upcoming general election in 2024, the SBI report has projected a total voter turnout of around 68 crore, <br>
  of which women voters could be at 33 crore (49%). From 2029 onwards, the women voters at 37 crore could be outstripping registered<br>
  men voters at 36 crore, the SBI report said. It further projected that in 2047, women's voter turnout might increase to 55% and men's voter turnout<br>
  might fall to 45%. Rising participation of women in India's political arena has been witnessed in the past one decade.<br>
  In the 1951 elections, only eight crore voted. In the 2009 elections, this was 42 crores, of which 19 crores were women.<br>
  In 2014, the voter turnout increased by 13.7 crore to 55 crore of which 26 crores were women. It was 5.8x higher for women and 5.2x for men.<br>
  In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the female voter turnout rate was higher than males.<br>
  As many as 67.18% of women voters cast a vote in the 2019 general election in contrast to 67.01% of males.</p>
