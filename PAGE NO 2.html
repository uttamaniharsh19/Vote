  <h1>Procession</h1>
  <p>
    A Party or candidate organizing a procession shall decide beforehand the time and place of the starting of the procession,
    the route to be followed and the time and place at which the procession will terminate. There shall ordinarily be no deviation from the programme.
    The organizers shall give advance intimation to the local police authorities of the programme so as to enable the latter to make necessary arrangements.
    The organizers shall ascertain if any restrictive orders are in force in the localities through which the procession has to pass, and shall comply
    with the restrictions unless exempted specially by the competent authority. Any traffic regulations or restrictions shall also be carefully adhered to.
    The organizers shall take steps in advance to arrange for the passage of the procession so that there is no block or hindrance to traffic.
    If the procession is very long, it shall be organized in segments of suitable lengths, so that at convenient intervals, especially at points
    where the procession has to pass road junctions, the passage of held-up traffic could be allowed by stages thus avoiding heavy traffic congestion.
    Processions shall be so regulated as to keep as much to the right of the road as possible and the direction and advice of the police
    on duty shall be strictly complied with. If two or more political parties or candidates propose to take processions over the same route or parts
    thereof at about the same time, the organizers shall establish contact well in advance and decide upon the measures to be taken to see that the processions
    do not clash or cause hindrance to traffic. The assistance of the local police shall be availed of for arriving at a satisfactory arrangement.
    For this purpose, the parties shall contact the police at the earliest opportunity. The political parties or candidates shall exercise control
    to the maximum extent possible in the matter of processionists carrying articles which may be put to misuse by undesirable elements especially
    in moments of excitement. The carrying of effigies purporting to represent members of other political parties or their leaders,
    burning such effigies in public and such other forms of demonstration shall not be countenanced by any political party or candidate.
